# AWS 3-Tier Web Application Architecture using Terraform

This project builds a highly available and scalable 3-tier web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. It includes a public-facing Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances for the application layer, and an RDS MySQL database for persistent storage.

## üìå Project Overview

This architecture is designed for production-ready, fault-tolerant, and secure deployments across multiple availability zones.

### Architecture Summary

- **VPC** with 6 subnets across 2 AZs:
  - 2 Public Subnets (for ALB)
  - 2 Private Subnets (for EC2 app layer)
  - 2 Private Subnets (for RDS database layer)
- **Internet Gateway** for public access
- **NAT Gateways** (1 per AZ) for secure internet access from private subnets
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for distributing traffic across EC2 instances
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** with Launch Template for application EC2 instances
- **RDS MySQL Instance** (DB Instance with Read Replica )
- **Security Groups** for granular traffic control
